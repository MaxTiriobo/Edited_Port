        <p>For the 60, 30, 10 rule, I decided to keep black the primary color, 
            <br>at least on dark mode, and Green the 30, secondary color because it is the 
            <br>color of our school. lastly, I made white the text, so it can stand out and be readable against the black.
        </p>
        <p>
            Secondly, I changed the color of the buttons from red, it just out expecially against the green. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Lastly, I took out the top image to create a more organized and sleek look.
